### network analysis in R

To understand the impact of the pandemic on American cities, this project constructs spatial interaction networks from mobility data. For each metropolitan area in the nation, we build an origin-destination matrix representing travel between Census Block Groups. From there we perform a series of computations to determine the network structure of that city and how it changed during 2020.
